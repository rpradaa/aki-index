### Step 2: Foundation ‚Äî Build, Analyze, and Learn with Agentic AI Guidance

This tool lets you construct your own index from the **Magnificent 7** tech stocks, assign weights (manually or with AI guidance), and compare to the S&P 500.  
You'll get real-time, context-aware feedback and actionable insights‚Äîjust like a portfolio manager with an AI co-pilot.

### **Step 2: Foundation ‚Äî What‚Äôs Happening?**
- **Portfolio Construction:** You select stocks and assign weights, or let the AI suggest weights based on recent volatility (risk-aware).
- **Agentic AI Guidance:** The system provides instant feedback on diversification, risk, and performance, and suggests improvements or alternatives.
- **Benchmarking:** The S&P 500 is your reference‚Äîsee if your custom index outperforms or underperforms.
- **Educational:** Learn portfolio theory and best practices interactively, with AI feedback.

#### **What is the Index Ratio?**
- The **Index Ratio** = Your Index (t) / S&P 500 (t)
- **Above 1:** Outperforming S&P 500. **Below 1:** Underperforming.
- This gives you a clear, at-a-glance sense of relative performance.

#### **Agentic Value**
- **Responsive:** The AI adapts its feedback and suggestions to your choices, helping you learn and improve.
- **Actionable:** Use the platform to explore, optimize, and understand portfolio construction at a professional level.
